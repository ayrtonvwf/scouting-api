# General notes

## Token

In almost every request, a header "Token" is required.

The exceptions are when the user is not logged in (account creation and the login proccess itself).

A token is valid for 12 hours, and you can "renew" it anytime you want.

## Team responsible

The first user to be assigned in a team is the team's administrator on the system.

This user needs to get verified for being the administrator.

The verification proccess is yet being designed, but may be a manual proccess (like some kind of post on Facebook, proving that the person has access to the Facebook page's administration).
